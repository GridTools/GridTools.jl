# clone gt4py
git clone --branch fix_python_interp_path_in_cmake git@github.com:tehrengruber/gt4py.git

## Troubleshooting

__undefined symbol: PyObject_Vectorcall__

Make sure to run everything in the same environment that you have build `PyCall` with. A common reason is you have built PyCall in a virtual environement and then didn't load it when executing stencils.
